* Are agency contact name, email, and phone redundent with the info in the related agency?
* Can avgApplicationTime, currentEmployeesRequired,  annualRevenue, age be converted from strings to ranges of two integers?
  * If so can we have humans manually migrate some of this information?  Probably only afew days of data entry.
  * If so how soon can we have people do that? I could have something that people could use in a week or two easily.
* Should all of the dropdowns and multiselects be converted from strings to foreign keys?
* Agencies have sparse data on emails but each opp. has an agnecy email, should we fix this?
* Is locations list exhaustive? Is it complete and precise? Is this what PR wants in describing opportunities? Would it be better to have a postal code, zip code or other spatial recognition?
